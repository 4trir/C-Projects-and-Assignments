Currently this project is not working due to compatibility issues between the SFML and Windows

I am working on a fix hopefully finshed by the end of summer.


This is Space Defenders, an infinite side scrolling space game, where you pilot a ship and destroy other craft while trying to stay alive. Any features that are not implemented 
are for future development of the game.
